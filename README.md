# Hierarchical vs network clustering
Code and materials accompanying the paper "Identifying similarities in text analysis: Hierarchical clustering (linkage) versus network clustering (community detection)" presented during DH 2019 conference in Utrecht by Jeremi K. Ochab (@remolek), Joanna Byszuk (@JoannaBy), Steffen Pielström (@pielstroem) and Maciej Eder (@computationalstylistics).  
## Corpora
We used three reference corpora for authorship attribution, each composed of 75 novels by 25 authors. These corpora, from English, French and German literature were previously used in various studies on text distance measures (e.g. Jannidis et al. 2015) and are [freely available](https://github.com/cophi-wue/refcor).
As examples for problems featuring two major stylistic groups, we took (1) a corpus of 17th century French drama published by [Christof Schöch](https://github.com/cligs/textbox/), where we removed all texts not clearly labeled comedies or tragedies - see [TragedyComedy corpus](https://github.com/JoannaBy/hierarchical-vs-network-clustering/tree/master/corpora/TragedyComedy); (2) a corpus containing Latin verse and prose from the so-called Golden Age - see [ProseVerse](https://github.com/JoannaBy/hierarchical-vs-network-clustering/tree/master/corpora/ProseVerse); (3) a corpus of Latin historiography containing texts from the very same Golden Age (late first century BCE) on the one hand, and the “Silver Age” on the other - see [EarlyLate](https://github.com/JoannaBy/hierarchical-vs-network-clustering/tree/master/corpora/EarlyLate). The Latin materials were assembled from the [Latin Library](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/).
